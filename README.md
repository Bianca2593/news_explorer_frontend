# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# News Explorer

News Explorer is a responsive React-based web application that allows users to search for the latest news articles by keyword.  
It integrates with a third-party news API to display real-time results, while also providing user-friendly features like loading indicators, error states, and modal authentication forms.

---

## Features

- **Responsive layout** (desktop, tablet, mobile)  
- **Search functionality**: fetches news from an external API (`NewsAPI` via `nomoreparties.co` proxy)  
- **Preloader**: animated loader while fetching data  
- **Error handling**: shows “Nothing found” if no results are returned  
- **About section**: author profile and description  
- **Modal windows**:
  - Sign in  
  - Sign up  
  - Registration success  
- **Card layout** for displaying news articles (image, title, description, date, link)

---

## Tech Stack

- **React** (with hooks)  
- **React Router**  
- **Vite** (development & build tool)  
- **CSS (BEM)** with responsive design  
- **gh-pages** for deployment
